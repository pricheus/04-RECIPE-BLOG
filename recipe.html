          Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
          recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny
          its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

                <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse
                the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and
                stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also
                pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be
                sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of
                a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan
                first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust
                down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and
                place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil
                will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow
                crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.

                <strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand
                mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and
                granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the
                sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until
                fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
                beating after each addition until just blended. After the final
                egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help
                prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,
                avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

                pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for
                the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire
